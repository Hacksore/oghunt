### Development

Create a ProductHunt account. Then, go to your [API Dashboard](https://www.producthunt.com/v2/oauth/applications). Afterwards, create an application. Set the redirect URI to `https://localhost:3000` for local development purposes. Then, generate a `Developer Token`, copy that, create a `.env` file in the root of this project's directory and paste that like:

```
API_TOKEN=myTokenHereUwu
```
