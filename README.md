## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `web`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app powering oghunt

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for code linting and formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm build
```

### Development

This is what you need to get up and running

1. Create a ProductHunt account. Then, go to your [API Dashboard](https://www.producthunt.com/v2/oauth/applications). Afterwards, create an application. Set the redirect URI to `https://localhost:3000` for local development purposes. Then, generate a `Developer Token`.

2. Generate a Gemini API key:
   - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the key for use in your environment variables

3. Create a `.env` file similar to [.env.example](/.env.example) with the following variables:
   - `CRON_SECRET`: Set to whatever you'd like locally
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Set to `"postgresql://dev:dev@localhost:5432/oghunt"`
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Gemini API key from step 2
   - `PRODUCTHUNT_TOKEN`: Your ProductHunt Developer Token from step 1
   - `LOOPS_FORM_ENDPOINT`:  Set to whatever you'd like locally

4. Start the database:
```
docker compose up -d
```

5. With the docker container running in the background, install dependencies and set up the database:
   - `pnpm i`
   - `pnpm db:push` (only needed once to push these changes to the local DB)
   - `pnpm dev`

6. Seed the database:
   - Send a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/api/ingest-posts`
   - Include the header: `Authorization: Bearer CRON_SECRET` where `CRON_SECRET` matches your `.env` value
